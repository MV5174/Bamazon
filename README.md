# Bamazon

Bamazon has 3 levels of functionality: for customers to buy product, for a manager to organize and change the table as needed for product, and for a supervisor to be able to view overall departments.

Bamazon is useful because it is a multipurpose service that allows different groups of people achieve what they want from a virtual storefront!

Users can start the project by running the function as they want from node (customer, manager, supervisor) and the rest is taken care of by the program!
